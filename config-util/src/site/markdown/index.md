Config Utilities
================

Utilities for handling config files with a type safe interface. The purpose
of the config utilities is to be an interface between 'flat' structured
config files, and a deeply structured config. The input and output formats
of the config is always flat, or maximally sectioned in named 'prefix sections'.

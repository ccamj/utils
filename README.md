**PS:** This project aims for _stability_, so if it appears to be running stale
means that it does not have new needed features, and has not needed recent
bug-fixes. To gauge if it is maintained enough for your project to feel confident,
it is at least used in these projects:

* [providence](http://www.morimekta.net/providence). Full stack Java replacement
  for Apache Thrift. Has extensible code generator, maven & gradle plugin, and
  various handy tools and utilities.
* [idltool](https://github.com/morimekta/idltool): A java based port and
  functionality-cleanup of Ãœber's node.js based [idl](https://github.com/uber-node/idl)
  tool.

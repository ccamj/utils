Utilities for handling config files with a type safe interface. The purpose
of the config utilities is to be an interface between 'flat' structured
config files, and a deeply structured config. The input and output formats
of the config is always flat, or maximally sectioned in named 'prefix sections'.

**NOTE**: Since the `providence-config` project was more or less completed,
I have concluded that this library is *deprecated* and the type-safe config
provided by providence used instead. This library will be kept until the
end of the '2.x' versions, but will probably stay compatible with future
versions of io-utils (it's only local dependency).

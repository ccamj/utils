The stages done to make a release.

### Making a SNAPSHOT release

Snapshot releases can be made directly from the `master` branch.

* Run `# mvn clean install` from master at the desired commit.

Snapshot releases are not supposed to be deployed. Therefore the
`<snapshotRepository>` is **NOT** set in the master pom. Note that
it is only commented out, in case a release is really needed.

### Making a version release

Before releasing check for dependency updates. Except for `guava`
the dependencies should only be used for testing, so updates are
truly safe.

```bash
# Check for dependency and plugin updates:
mvn versions:display-dependency-updates
mvn versions:display-plugin-updates
```

The release proper is done with a branch cut, and using the maven
release plugin:

```
# Make the maven release:
mvn release:prepare
mvn release:perform
git fetch origin
```

* Check sonatype staging repository found at the
  [Nexus Repository Manager](https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories). And if
  correct, do the release. If not a git hard rollback is needed (to remove release
  version, tag and commits).

Now the release is complete.
